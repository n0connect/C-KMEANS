## Overview

K-means clustering is a widely used algorithm in machine learning and data mining that partitions a dataset into clusters based on feature similarity. This project provides a simple yet efficient implementation in C, designed for performance with minimal dependencies.

## Features

- **Regenerate Datasets:** Easy dataset generation for experimentation.
- **Efficient Clustering:** Optimized for speed, capable of handling large datasets.
- **Modular Codebase:** Well-structured for ease of extension or modification.

## Installation

To install and use this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/n0connect/C-KMEANS.git
2. Navigate to the project directory::
   ```bash
   cd C-KMEANS
3. Navigate to the project directory::
   ```bash
   ./build.sh
   
**Note: Make sure you have a C compiler (e.g., gcc) installed and set up on your system

## Usage

### Running the program
KEY_R = Regenerate the dataset
KEY_SPACE = One itteration for the set

## Experimental
**It was just an experimental test project.
